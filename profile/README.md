## ENRE

### WHAT IS ENRE?

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
**ENRE** supports the extraction of **entities** and their
**dependencies** from systems written in multiple languages, enables the customization of dependencies of interest to the user, and makes implicit dependencies explicit. 

### Features
- üì° Supports multiple programming languages
- üîó Robust and flexible
- üß∞ Support possible dependencies in weak typing languages


### Supports
‚åõÔ∏è By doing static analysis, **ENRE** supports the following entities and dependency types.
